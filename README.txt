Final project by Tomer Gresler

This project was done as a final assignmet in course 20465 of the open university

To make it short, this project is a two part pass assembler.

Each .c file contains a description of what it does(what is his part of the project)

Enjoy messing with it and reding through.

The program starts from the main file.

run1 is the name of our program file.

To run the program, open a terminal from within this file, and type make then press enter
next, type ./run1 test(where test is the name of the file you want to run our program on)
